        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Norwegian rice porridge, grøt or risgrøt, at its simplest consists of rice cooked with water and milk, and
            maybe a pinch of salt. One of the best parts is you can make riskrem from the porridge leftovers: just mix in
            whipped cream and use the topping of your choice (e.g. raspberry sauce)
        </p>
        <p>One of the biggest decisions to make for risgrøt is the type of rice to choose. Some recipes call for short-,
            medium-, or long-grain. I’ve always used short-grain for my riskrem, so that’s what I’m using here as well.
            Specifically, I use arborio, an Italian short-grain rice.
        </p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>&frac34; cup arborio rice</li>
            <li>1 &frac12; cups water</li>
            <li>&frac12; teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>3 cups whole milk</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons sugar</li>
            <li>1 vanilla bean (cut lengthwise and seeds scraped out, both pod and seeds reserved)</li>
            <li>1 cinnamon stick</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>For serving</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>4 thins slices cold butter</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons ground cinnamon</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons granulated sugar</li>
            <li>1 whole blanched almond</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><p>In a medium pot, bring rice, water, and salt to a boil. Lower heat and maintain a good simmer, uncovered,
                until the rice absorbs the water, stirring regularly so the rice doesn’t stick.</p>
            </li>
            <li><p>Add the milk, sugar, vanilla seeds and pod, cinnamon stick, and mix it in. Continue to simmer, covered.
                Stir regularly until the milk is absorbed and rice is tender, about a half an hour or so.
                Check regularly and add more milk as needed.</p>
            </li>
            <li><p>Remove vanilla pod and cinnamon stick. Taste and add additional sugar if desired. Transfer porridge
                to a serving dish or to four bowls, tucking a single whole almond somewhere inside one of the
                servings. Sprinkle with additional sugar and ground cinnamon and top with a pat of cold butter.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
