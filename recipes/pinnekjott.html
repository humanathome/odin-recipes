        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>While <a href="ribbe.html">ribbe</a> is considered the most popular Christmas dish, pinnekjøtt is normally the favourite among the population
            of western parts of Norway. Easily explained, pinnekjøtt is lamb ribs that have been salted, and sometimes also smoked
            to preserve it.
        </p>
        <p>Though it is fairly easy meal to make, it is by no means quick. For preparation, the meat needs to be soaked in water
            to remove most of the salt, which could take around 30 hours!
        </p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 kg pinnekjøtt (mutton ribs)</li>
            <li>1 &frac14; swedes (also known as swedish turnip or rutabaga)</li>
            <li>2 carrots</li>
            <li>1 potato</li>
            <li>1 dl cream</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons butter</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons salt</li>
            <li>&frac12; teaspoon pepper</li>
            <li> sausage (optional)</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><p>Soak the ribs in plenty of water and leave covered in room temperature for about 30 hours.<p></li>
            <li><p>Place a metal grate at the base of a wide saucepan. Refill water so it levels the grate. Add the meat on top and
                cover with a lid. Steam on low heat for about 3 hours. Top up with more water if necessary so it does not leave the
                meat dry. <em>Optional: add the sausages and leave them in for the remaining 15 minutes.</em></p>
            </li>
            <li><p>Peel the swedes, carrot and potatoes. Cut them in rough pieces and boil them in lightly salted water until tender.</p>
            </li>
            <li><p>Add butter and cream to the mash. Season with salt and pepper, and perhaps a little grated nutmeg.
                <strong>God appetitt!</strong></p>
            </li>
        </ol>
